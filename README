geodist calculates and displays geodesic distances on triangle meshes.
As written right now it uses some faked transparency when drawing.
Press r to pick a different point to find distance from, b to choose
the boundary of the mesh, and q or ESC to exit.

geodist_tet calculates and displays geodesic distances on tetrahedral
meshes. Press r to pick a different point to find distance from, q or
ESC to exit.

square_gen and cube_gen generate triangle and tetrahedral meshes.
